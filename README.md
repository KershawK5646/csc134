##Getting Started
You will need to install a C++ compiler for your platform of choice. See: http://stroustrup.com/compilers.html for a full list.

###Windows
I recommend Visual Studio 2017 Community, but Visual Studio 2017 Express works just as well. 

####Installing Visual Studio 2017 Community
Go to https://www.visualstudio.com/
Select "Download for Windows", then "Community 2017"
Run the installer, which will ask which components you wish to install.
VS defaults to a large install of a lot of things you do not need. The only option you should check is "Desktop Development with C++". I recommend you uncheck all other options.
Select "Install" (or "Modify" if you are making changes to an existing install).
